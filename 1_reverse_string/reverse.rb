# Given a string, return a new string with the reversed order of characters.

# Examples:

# reverse('apple') === 'leppa'
# reverse('hello') === 'olleh'
# reverse('Greetings!') === '!sgniteerG'
# You should put your implementation into the reverse function that was defined for you below.  You don't need 
# to call reverse yourself.  Example of what your completed code should look like:

def reverse(str)
